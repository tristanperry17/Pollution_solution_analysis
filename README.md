This quick project seeks to find a solution to the following prompt and questions:

Assessing an air pollution intervention
According to the World Health Organization, air pollution kills more than 5 million people each year. The main culprit is PM2.5 — small particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.

One of the most tragic effects of particulate pollution is the premature death of newborn children. As described in this paper by Heft-Neal et al. (https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26107/w26107.pdf), reducing this pollution is a potentially promising way to save infant lives.

Imagine that you are a grantmaker who has encountered an intervention, similar to the one described in Heft-Neal et al., that can reduce PM2.5 pollution by 5 μg/m3 (5 micrograms per cubic meter) wherever it is deployed, and therefore save newborn lives. Assume that this intervention has no negative side effects, and ignore other potential positive effects (such as accelerated economic growth). The developer of this intervention hopes to expand it to one of four countries. In each country, however, the costs of implementing the program will be different.

In Sierra Leone, the program will cost $15 million per year.
In Cote d'Ivoire, the program will cost $20 million per year.
In Togo, the program will cost $6 million per year.
In Ghana, the program will cost $20 million per year.


CSV files were downloaded from DataCommons (Example source for Sierra Leone data: https://datacommons.org/place/country/SLE?utm_medium=explore&mprop=count&popt=Person&hl=en)
Infant mortality percentage, and cost per capita of implementation were graphed to compare trends and values.

Questions:

Q1: In which country will you implement the intervention?
A1: Sierra Leone - Upon visual analysis of trends observed in population, infant mortality rate, and cost per capita of implementation, the country with the highest value of implementation could be Sierra Leone, due to having the second highest population, highest infant mortality rate by far, and lowest cost of implementation out of all four countries.

Q2: Very briefly, what uncertainties do you have about your analysis? What assumptions did you make?
A1: Uncertainties for this portion of analysis were data source accuracy, and the assumption that rainfall is consistent in all four countries, which should be considered for efficacy of the proposed solution.
